# Nus3bank-volume-GUI
This is meant to be a simple GUI that can edit the volume of a nus3bank file. It should help in modding Super Smash Bros. Ultimate.

This was made using PySimpleGUI, and this wouldn't be possible without the help of [zrksyd](https://github.com/zrksyd) who made the original [volume.py](https://gist.github.com/zrksyd/8e25e9ea5244714c5418d466a424107e) file, which was a CLI tool to adjust the volume of nus3bank files.
